# Iris Species Classification

Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process involves predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

## Problem Description : 

Our aim is to create a model that can classify dataset flower samples according to their species, based on the training we give to the model. This will be done with the help of certain physical properties of the flower samples.


## Understanding our Dataset :
We will be using a [Iris FLower Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from the UCI Machine Learning repository which has a very good collection of datasets for experimental research purposes. The direct data link is [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/).

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Here's a picture of the three different Iris types:
